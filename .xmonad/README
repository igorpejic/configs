Also, see bin directory in this repo for `hclxm' a bash script or
alias to clean up all .o and .hi files in .xmonad and subdirectories
(like .xmonad/lib), then xmonad --recompile && xmonad --restart

Eventually this functionality may be part of xmonad, but for now it
can be handy when jumping between xmonad versions or changing
ghc versions.
